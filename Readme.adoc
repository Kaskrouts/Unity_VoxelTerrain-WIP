Motivation
----------
I've been interested for a long time in voxel and dynamic terrain generation. So i decided to do a small project, of my own, for education purposes.
It is, without a doubt, a slow learning process since i was not used to programming with *C#* and above all the huge variety of tools provided by the Unity engine.

*this is by no mean a full project as the soul purpose of it is purely educational*

Functionality and Progress
--------------------------
the program basically, generates a random world (given the world size),to my humble understaning ,as efficiently as possible. By efficient, i mean not generating all the textures that should not be visible to the sore eye (for example: all the blocks below ground should not have a visible texture unless updated)

TO-DO'S
-------
* dynamic terrain generation : the world should be able to update itself dynamically as the camera moves around.
* Caves : the program lacks caves, since i chose, for the moment, to fill each gap with water
* more blocks variety : it currenty has only grass (for surfaces) and water (for ravines/holes)
